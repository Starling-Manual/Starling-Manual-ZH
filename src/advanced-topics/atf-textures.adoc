== ATF纹理

在常规Flash中，大多数开发人员使用PNG图像格式，如果不需要透明度，则使用JPG。
那些图像格式在Starling中也同样受欢迎。
但是，Stage3D提供了一个具有几个独特优点的替代方法：Adobe Texture Format，它可以存储compressed纹理。

* 压缩纹理占用更小的存储空间。
* 直接在GPU上完成解压缩。
* 上传到显存更快。
* 上传可以异步完成：您可以加载新的纹理，而不中断游戏.footnote:[从AIR 24和Starling 2.2开始，这种纹理将变得很常用]

=== 显存

在我们继续之前，可能有兴趣了解一个纹理到底需要多少内存。

PNG图像为每个像素存储4个通道：red，green，blue和alpha，每个具有8位（每通道256个值）。
很容易计算512×512像素纹理占用的空间：

====
512×512 RGBA纹理的内存占用：+
512×512像素×4字节= 1,048,576字节≈1MB
====

JPG图像基实也是类似的;不同的是它不需要alpha通道。

====
512×512 RGB纹理的内存占用：+
512×512像素×3字节= 786,432字节≈768kB
====

Quite a lot for such a small texture, right?
Beware that the built-in file compression of _PNG_ and _JPG_ does not help: the image has to be decompressed before _Stage3D_ can handle it.
In other words: the file size does not matter; the memory consumption is always calculated with the above formula.

Nevertheless: if your textures easily fit into graphics memory that way -- go ahead and use them!
Those formats are very easy to work with and will be fine in many situations, especially if your application is targeting desktop hardware.

However, there might come a moment in the development phase where your memory consumption is higher than what is available on the device.
This is the right time to look at the ATF format.

=== Compressed Textures

Above, we learned that the file size of a conventional texture has nothing to do with how much graphics memory it uses; a massively compressed _JPG_ will take up just as much space as the same image in pure _BMP_ format.

This is not true for compressed textures: they can be processed directly on the GPU.
This means that, depending on the compression settings, you can load up to ten times as many textures.
Quite impressive, right?

Unfortunately, each GPU vendor thought he could do better than the others, and so there are several different formats for compressed textures.
In other words: depending on where your game is running, it will need a different kind of texture.
How should you know beforehand which file to include?

This where ATF comes to the rescue.
It is a format that Adobe created especially for _Stage3D_; actually, it is a container file that can include up to four different versions of a texture.

* *PVRTC* (PowerVR Texture Compression) is used in PowerVR GPUs. It is supported by all generations of the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad.
* *DXT1/5* (S3 Texture Compression) was originally developed by S3 Graphics. It is now supported by both Nvidia and AMD GPUs, and is thus available on most desktop computers, as well as some Android phones.
* *ETC* (Ericsson Texture Compression) is used on many mobile phones, most notably on Android.
* *ETC2* provides higher quality RGB and RGBA compression. It is supported by all Android and iOS devices that also support OpenGL ES 3.

I wrote before that ATF is a _container_ format. That means that it can include any combination of the the above formats.

.An ATF file is actually a container for other formats.

When you include all formats (which is the default), the texture can be loaded on any Stage3D-supporting device, no matter if your application is running on iOS, Android, or on the Desktop.
You don't have to care about the internals!

However, if you know that your game will only be deployed to, say, iOS devices, you can omit all formats except PVRTC.
Or if you're only targeting high end mobile devices (with at least _OpenGL ES 3_), include only ETC2; that works on both Android and iOS.
That way, you can optimize the download size of your game.

[NOTE]
====
The difference between DXT1 and DXT5 is just that the latter supports an alpha channel.
Don't worry about this, though: the ATF tools will choose the right format automatically.

ETC1 actually does not support an alpha channel, but Stage3D works around this by using two textures internally. Again, this happens completely behind the scenes.

=== Creating an ATF texture

Adobe provides a set of command line tools to convert to and from ATF and to preview the generated files.
They are part of the AIR SDK (look for the `atftools` folder).

Probably the most important tool is `png2atf`.
Here is a basic usage example; it will compress the texture with the standard settings in all available formats.

----
png2atf -c -i texture.png -o texture.atf
----

If you tried that out right away, you probably received the following error message, though:

----
Dimensions not a power of 2!
----

That's a limitation I have not mentioned yet: ATF textures are required to always have side-lengths that are powers of two.
While this is a little annoying, it's actually rarely a problem, since you will almost always use them for atlas textures.

TIP: Most atlas generators can be configured so that they create power-of-two textures.

When the call succeeds, you can review the output in the _ATFViewer_.

.The _ATFViewer_ tool.
image::atf-viewer.png[ATFViewer]

In the list on the left, you can choose which internal format you want to view.
Furthermore, you see that, per default, all mipmap variants have been created.

NOTE: We will discuss mipmaps in the <<Memory Management>> chapter.

You will probably also notice that the image quality has suffered a bit from the compression.
This is because all those compression formats are _lossy_: the smaller memory footprint comes at the prize of a reduced quality.
How much the quality suffers is depending on the type of image: while organic, photo-like textures work well, comic-like images with hard edges can suffer quite heavily.

The tool provides a lot of different options, of course.
E.g. you can let it package only the PVRTC format, perfect for iOS:

----
png2atf -c p -i texture.png -o texture.atf
----

Or you can tell it to omit mipmaps in order to save memory:

----
png2atf -c -n 0,0 -i texture.png -o texture.atf
----

Another useful utility is called `atfinfo`.
It displays details about the data that's stored in a specific ATF file, like the included texture formats, the number of mipmaps, etc.

----
> atfinfo -i texture.atf

File Name          : texture.atf
ATF Version        : 2
ATF File Type      : RAW Compressed With Alpha (DXT5+ETC1/ETC1+PVRTV4bpp)
Size               : 256x256
Cube Map           : no
Empty Mipmaps      : no
Actual Mipmaps     : 1
Embedded Levels    : X........ (256x256)
AS3 Texture Class  : Texture (flash.display3D.Texture)
AS3 Texture Format : Context3DTextureFormat.COMPRESSED_ALPHA
----

=== Using ATF Textures

Using a compressed texture in Starling is just as simple as any other texture.
Pass the byte array with the file contents to the factory method `Texture.fromAtfData()`.

[source, as3]
----
var atfData:ByteArray = getATFBytes(); // <1>
var texture:Texture = Texture.fromATFData(atfData); // <2>
var image:Image = new Image(texture); // <3>
----
<1> Get the raw data e.g. from a file.
<2> Create the ATF texture.
<3> Use it like any other texture.

That's it! This texture can be used like any other texture in Starling.
It's also a perfectly suitable candidate for your atlas texture.

However, the code above will upload the texture synchronously, i.e. AS3 execution will pause until that's done.
To load the texture asynchronously instead, pass a callback to the method:

[source, as3]
----
Texture.fromATFData(atfData, 1, true,
    function(texture:Texture):void
    {
        var image:Image = new Image(texture);
    });
----

Parameters two and three control the scale factor and if mipmaps should be used, respectively.
The fourth one, if passed a callback, will trigger asynchronous loading: Starling will be able to continue rendering undisturbed while that happens.
As soon as the callback has been executed (but not any sooner!), the texture will be usable.

Of course, you can also embed the ATF file directly in the AS3 source.

[source, as3]
----
[Embed(source="texture.atf", mimeType="application/octet-stream")]
public static const CompressedData:Class;

var texture:Texture = Texture.fromEmbeddedAsset(CompressedData);
----

Note, however, that asynchronous upload is not available in this case.
