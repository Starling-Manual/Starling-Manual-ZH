# The Starling Manual - Chinese

The goal of this manual is to provide an extensive introduction to the [Starling Framework][1].
Starling is a cross-platform engine for _ActionScript 3_ that can be used for all kinds of applications, with a special focus on 2D games.

This repository provides the basis for the [Chinese online manual][2].
It is written in the [AsciiDoc][3] markup language and can be easily compiled into HTML, PDF and EPUB.
Have a look at the `BUILD.md` file to find out how to compile the source yourself.

## Translations

Are you interested in helping out the Starling community by translating this manual into your native language?
Eternal fame and thankfulness of the Starling community would be yours!

If so, please simply open up an issue in [this repository][4], stating the language you want to help with.
I will then create a fork of this repository and set it up for you with full access rights.
Detailed instructions about how the translation process works can be found in the [wiki][5].

Thanks a lot in advance!
